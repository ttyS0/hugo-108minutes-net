Since forever ago I’ve thought a single site that collected technical, and not so technical content was the way to go. It’s taken me forever to realize that approach doesn’t work for me. As a result I’m trying a different approach. This site is where all my non-tech related writings go. In some ways it makes this more of a traditional "blog". For tech related stuff, go to [skj.dev](https://skj.dev). 


I also dabble in fiction writing, but I'm unsure whether I'll put any of that here, or make a totally different site for that content. Who knows, one day I may just squish everything together into one unifying site. As suggested at the top, I'm very fickle about website stuff.
